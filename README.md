# Start
Making a basic code base to handle day to day tasks.
The ideas is to have a set of code base ready to fasten the work I do. 

Feel free to look at the examples code to see how this code base can be used.

I intend to write following Algorithms for this code base in Examples Folder:
  1) Simple Classification - Currently implemented with Cifar-10 dataset
  2) Transfer Learning - Currently implemented with Cifar-10 dataset
  3) Meta-Learning - Currently implemented with Cifar-10 dataset
  4) Facial Point Recognition - Currently implement Udacity Facial Point Dataset
  5) Instance Segmentation - Will likely use MSCOCO Dataset
  6) Semantic Segementation - Will likely use MSCOCO Dataset
  7) Domain Adaption - Algorithm and dataset are yet to be decided
  8) Single Shot Learning - Face Recognition using limited Samples
