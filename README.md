# Start
Making a basic code base to handle day to day tasks.
The ideas is to have a set of code base ready to fasten the work I do. 

Feel free to look at the examples code to see how this code base can be used.

I intend to write following Algorithms for this code base for my day to day work in Examples Folder:
  1) Simple Classification - Currently implemented with Cifar-10 dataset
  2) Transfer Learning - Currently implemented with Cifar-10 dataset
  3) Meta-Learning - Currently implemented with Cifar-10 dataset
  5) AutoML - Yet to be implemented


Following are some of the algorithms which I wish to implement for further deepening the understanding and exploration of topics:
  1) Facial Point Recognition - Currently implemented Udacity Facial Point Dataset
  2) Object Detection - Will likely use MSCOCO Dataset
  3) Single Shot Learning - Face Recognition using limited Samples
  4) Semantic Segementation - Will likely use ISIC Dataset
  5) Instance Segmentation - Will likely use MSCOCO Dataset
  6) Domain Adaption - Algorithm and dataset are yet to be decided
  7) Noise Removal From Images- Can be done using any image Dataset.
  8) StyleGAN2ADA - Can be done using any image Dataset.
